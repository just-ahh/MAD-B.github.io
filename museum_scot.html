	<div id="review"> <h3> Make the Best Fit </h3>
<p>Within this game, players must place all the different sized shapes within the area with as little wasted space as possible. <br> <br>
	To make the game more challenging there is a time limit for each level with several difficulty levels to choose from, ranging from easy to master. <br> <br> 
	Each attempt gives the player a percentage score about how much area was used so they can improve on their technique and speed.
