	<div id="review"> <h3> Make the Best Fit </h3>
<p>Within this game, players must place all the different sized shapes within the area with as little wasted space as possible. <br> <br>
	To make the game more challenging there is a time limit for each level with several difficulty levels to choose from, ranging from easy to master. <br> <br> 
	Each attempt gives the player a percentage score about how much area was used so they can improve on their technique and speed.

Says the Science and technology section is great for both kids, teens and adults intrested in STEM, and thought it was displayed well for a wide audience.
