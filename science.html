	<div id="review"> <h3> Autopsy Game </h3>
<p> This game involves looking at different autopsy scans and looking at the different analysis of them to discover new information about each person. <br> <br>
	The game uses real scans of people who donated them to science and is an interesting way to look at what information can be found out about a person after death. <br> <br>
	Players need to use the touchscreen to pick different scan layers and use the tools at the side to look at cross sections of the body to see more information.

	<div id="review"> <h3> Digging for oil </h3>
<p>	Players have to sit down in a chair to be able to control the game on screen, users are in the control of an oil digger and must control direction, pressure and rotation speed to be able to safely dig for oil. <br> <br>
	The controls positioned on the armchair look simple but the act of multitasking all the different components is challenging.
