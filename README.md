# Museum Video Games for Adults.

Welcome to this website all about recommending different museum video games to adults to try get people to understand that they are not just for children. 

Many parts of this code have been learned and gathered from different sources listed below:
- W3Schools
- Stack Overflow
- Learn Flexbox in 15 Minutes by Web Dev Simplified. Accessed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE 
- CSS tricks. 

All the content on the website has been appropriately sourced from different locations as listed below:

Images 
-	From the museum of Scotland and the Glasgow science centre, taken by me.
-	Opening image of the Nintendo switch console is from Canva which can be used and edited without any copyright or licensing concerns.
-	Images on the benefits page of the blackboard and the phone playing candy crush are taken form Pexels which is also free to use without credit being required. 
-	The learning pyramid image is from The Education Corner article by Becton Loveless (2024) available at: https://www.educationcorner.com/the-learning-pyramid/ 
-	All Trip advisor reviews are taken from the Trip Advisor Website with links within each image to go back to tripadvisor.com to see each post in context. 

Videos
-	The videos featured on the website of the Burrell Collection were filmed and given with permission by a member of my peer support group. All individuals involved consented to having the video on the sight.
Text
-	Text has been written by me. The opening sentences on the website were put through ChatGPT in order to make it tidier and catchier than what I could come up with. That is the only area where AI has been used. 
-	The reasons on the benefits page can be attributed to several articles listed below:

Basaraba, N. 2022. Transmedia Narratives for Cultural Heritage: Remixing History. London: Routledge.

Kidd, J. 2016. Museums in the New Mediascape: Transmedia, Participation, Ethics. London: Routledge.

Strauss, V. 2021. Why the ‘learning pyramid’ is wrong. Washington Post. [Online]. [Accessed 12 April 2024]. Available from: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/03/06/why-the-learning-pyramid-is-wrong/.

Finally, this project wouldn’t have been possible without the feedback of my peer support group, members of staff and other testers who helped me to create this website!

Thank you for checking out this website!
